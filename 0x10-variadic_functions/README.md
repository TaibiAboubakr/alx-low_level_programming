# 0x10-variadic_functions Directory

This directory contains C programs related to variadic functions. Variadic functions are functions in C that can accept a variable number of arguments. They provide a flexible way to work with functions that may have a different number of arguments at runtime.

## Files

- 0-sum_them_all.c : This file contains a C function `sum_them_all` that calculates the sum of a variable number of integers. The function uses the variadic feature to accept a varying number of arguments.

-  1-print_numbers.c : In this file, you will find a C function `print_numbers` that prints a variable number of integers. The function utilizes variadic functionality to handle different numbers of arguments.

-  2-print_strings.c : This file contains a C function `print_strings` that prints a variable number of strings. Like the previous files, it makes use of variadic features.

-  3-print_all.c : Here, you will find a C function `print_all` that can print elements of different data types (char, integer, float, and string). It uses variadic functions to handle different argument types.

-  variadic_functions.h : This header file is included in all the C files mentioned above. It contains the function prototypes for all the variadic functions implemented in this directory.
