# Directory 0x1A-hash_tables

This directory contains code related to hash tables. Hash tables are a fundamental data structure used for efficient data storage and retrieval. 

A hash table uses a hash function to compute indexes for a key. You can store the value at the appropriate location based on the hash table index.

The benefit of using a hash table is its very fast access time. Typically, the time complexity (amortized time complexity) is a constant O(1) access time.
