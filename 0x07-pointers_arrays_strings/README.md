## Directory: 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory builds upon the concepts covered in the previous directories, 0x05 and 0x06, by delving even deeper into pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. It introduces additional techniques and functions for manipulating these data types effectively.

Topics Covered
Pointers: The directory covers advanced topics related to pointers, including pointer arithmetic, pointer to arrays, and pointer to functions. You will learn how to use these concepts to create more complex and efficient programs.

Arrays: Advanced array manipulation techniques are explored, such as dynamic arrays, multidimensional arrays, and arrays of function pointers. You will learn how to handle and manipulate arrays in different scenarios.

Strings: More advanced string manipulation functions and techniques are introduced. Functions like memset(), strstr(), strchr(), and others are covered in detail. You will also learn about string formatting and parsing techniques.
