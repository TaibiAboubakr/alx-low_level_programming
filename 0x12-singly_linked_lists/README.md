# 0x12-singly_linked_lists

## Description:
0x12-singly_linked_lists is a C programming project that implements a singly linked list data structure and provides various functions to manipulate and interact with the linked list.

A singly linked list is a linear data structure composed of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The project aims to create a linked list, perform common operations on it, and manage the list dynamically.

## Files

1. **0-print_list.c**:
   - This file contains the implementation of the function `print_list`, which takes a pointer to the start of a singly linked list and prints all the elements of the list.

2. **1-list_len.c**:
   - This file contains the implementation of the function `list_len`, which calculates and returns the number of elements in a singly linked list.

3. **2-add_node.c**:
   - This file contains the implementation of the function `add_node`, which adds a new node with the provided data to the beginning of a singly linked list.

4. **3-add_node_end.c**:
   - This file contains the implementation of the function `add_node_end`, which adds a new node with the provided data to the end of a singly linked list.

5. **4-free_list.c**:
   - This file contains the implementation of the function `free_list`, which frees the memory allocated for all the nodes in a singly linked list.

6. **lists.h**:
   - This header file contains the function prototypes for the functions implemented in the previous files. It provides the necessary declarations to use the singly linked list functions in other C files.

7. **100-first.c**:
   This file contains a function called `print_before_main`, which uses a GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) extension to execute certain code before the `main` function of a C program. It is a demonstration of how to execute code automatically before the program starts.
