## C Compilation Steps

This directory contains multiple scripts related to the different steps involved in compiling C programs: preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking. Here is a brief description of each step:

1. Preprocessing: Before compilation, the C preprocessor processes the source code files (`.c` files) and performs tasks such as including header files, macro expansions, and conditional compilation. This step generates preprocessed source code files (`.i` files).

2. Compiling: The compiler takes the preprocessed source code files and translates them into assembly code files (`.s` files) specific to the target architecture. It performs syntax and semantic analysis, optimizations, and generates assembly instructions.

3. Assembling: The assembler takes the assembly code files and translates them into object files (`.o` files). It converts the assembly instructions into machine code specific to the target processor. Each source code file usually results in a corresponding object file.

4. Linking: The linker combines the object files generated in the previous step along with any necessary library files and resolves external references. It creates the final executable file that can be executed by the operating system.

The compilation process typically involves invoking different tools or commands for each step. The provided scripts in this directory are designed to automate these steps and simplify the compilation process for C programs.

Make sure to refer to the specific instructions or documentation provided with each script to understand how to use them effectively for compiling your C programs.

Note: Understanding the individual compilation steps can be helpful for troubleshooting and advanced compilation scenarios.
