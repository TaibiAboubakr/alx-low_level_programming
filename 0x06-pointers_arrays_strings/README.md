## Directory: 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

- This directory builds upon the concepts covered in the previous directory, 0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings. It delves deeper into the topics of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language, providing additional knowledge and techniques to expand your understanding.

- The directory also expands on the manipulation of strings, introducing additional string handling functions and techniques. You will learn about string manipulation functions like strcpy(), strcat(),strcmp() which allow you to copy, concatenate and compare strings effectively.

- By studying the programs and concepts in this directory, you will enhance your skills in working with pointers, arrays, and strings. This will enable you to write more advanced C programs, handle complex data structures, and perform sophisticated string operations. Building on the foundation established in the previous directory, 0x05, this directory provides you with the necessary tools to tackle more challenging programming tasks
