# 0x0E-structures_typedef
This directory contains files related to the topic of structures and typedef in the C programming language. It explores the concept of defining custom data types using structures and typedefs.

## Files :
- dog.h, dog.c: These files contain the definition and implementation of a structure called dog. The dog structure represents information about a dog, such as its name, age, and owner. The header file (dog.h) declares the structure and function prototypes related to dog operations, while the source file (dog.c) provides the implementations.

- 1-init_dog.c: This file contains a function that initializes a dog structure with the given values for name, age, and owner. It demonstrates how to set the member values of a structure.

- 2-print_dog.c: This file contains a function that prints the contents of a dog structure. It demonstrates how to access and display the values stored in the structure's members.

- 4-new_dog.c: This file contains a function that creates a new dog structure and initializes its members with the given values. It showcases the process of dynamically allocating memory for a structure and setting its members.

- 5-free_dog.c: This file contains a function that frees the memory allocated for a dog structure. It prevents memory leaks by deallocating the dynamically allocated memory when a dog is no longer needed.
