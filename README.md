## Directory: 0x00-hello_world


### C Compilation Steps

This directory contains multiple scripts related to the different steps involved in compiling C programs: preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking. Here is a brief description of each step:

1. Preprocessing: Before compilation, the C preprocessor processes the source code files (`.c` files) and performs tasks such as including header files, macro expansions, and conditional compilation. This step generates preprocessed source code files (`.i` files).

2. Compiling: The compiler takes the preprocessed source code files and translates them into assembly code files (`.s` files) specific to the target architecture. It performs syntax and semantic analysis, optimizations, and generates assembly instructions.

3. Assembling: The assembler takes the assembly code files and translates them into object files (`.o` files). It converts the assembly instructions into machine code specific to the target processor. Each source code file usually results in a corresponding object file.

4. Linking: The linker combines the object files generated in the previous step along with any necessary library files and resolves external references. It creates the final executable file that can be executed by the operating system.

The compilation process typically involves invoking different tools or commands for each step. The provided scripts in this directory are designed to automate these steps and simplify the compilation process for C programs.

Make sure to refer to the specific instructions or documentation provided with each script to understand how to use them effectively for compiling your C programs.

Note: Understanding the individual compilation steps can be helpful for troubleshooting and advanced compilation scenarios.

## Directory: 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory contains programs written in the C programming language that delve into the concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings. Building upon the fundamental concepts covered in the previous directories (0x02-functions_nested_loops and 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops), this directory explores additional functionalities and techniques for manipulating and working with memory addresses, arrays, and strings in C.

## Directory: 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory builds upon the concepts covered in the previous directories, 0x05 and 0x06, by delving even deeper into pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. It introduces additional techniques and functions for manipulating these data types effectively.

## 0x08-recursion

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the concept of recursion. 
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. 
The programs in this directory showcase various examples of recursive functions.


## 0x09-static_libraries

This directory contains the source code and a static library for a collection of utility functions.

### Contents
1. main.h : file contains declaration of prototypes
2. libmy.a : static library libmy.a containing many functions
3. create_static_lib.sh : script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.


## 0x0A-argc_argv
This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of argc and argv in the main function.

+ Files :
0-whatsmyname.c: a program that prints its name
1-args.c : a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
and others :2-args.c,3-mul.c,4-add.c, 100-change.c

### Description
