# 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists

## Description:
The "0x13-more_singly_linked_lists" directory contains additional implementations and functions related to singly linked lists. A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node points to the next node in the list. It is called "singly" because the links between nodes are unidirectional.
