# Directory : 0x17 Doubly Linked Lists

This directory contains C code and associated files related to doubly linked lists. Doubly linked lists are a data structure used in computer science and programming for managing and organizing data elements. They consist of nodes that have pointers to both the next and previous nodes in the list, allowing for efficient traversal in both directions.

## Files

- `0-print_dlistint.c`: A C function that prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.
- `1-dlistint_len.c`: A C function that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
- `2-add_dnodeint.c`: A C function that adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- `3-add_dnodeint_end.c`: A C function that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- `4-free_dlistint.c`: A C function that frees a doubly linked list.
- `5-get_dnodeint.c`: A C function that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.
- `6-sum_dlistint.c`: A C function that computes the sum of all the data (integers) in a doubly linked list.
- `7-insert_dnodeint.c`: A C function that inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
- `8-delete_dnodeint.c`: A C function that deletes a node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
- `100-password`: A text file containing the password for a crackme-style program.
- `102-result`: A text file containing the output of a program.
